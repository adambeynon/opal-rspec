# opal-rspec

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/opal/opal-rspec/master.svg?style=flat)](http://travis-ci.org/opal/opal-rspec)

An attempt at a compatibility layer of rspec for opal.

[See the website for documentation](http://opalrb.org/docs/rspec/).

## Usage

Add `opal-rspec` to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'opal-rspec'
```

### Run specs in phantomjs

To run specs, a rake task can be added which will load all spec files from
`spec/`:

```ruby
require 'opal/rspec/rake_task'
Opal::RSpec::RakeTask.new(:default)
```

Then, to run your specs inside phantomjs, just run the rake task:

```
bundle exec rake
```

You can also customize the pattern of specs used similiar to how RSpec's rake task works:
```ruby
require 'opal/rspec/rake_task'
Opal::RSpec::RakeTask.new(:default) do |server, task|
	# server is an instance of Opal::Server in case you want to add to the load path, customize, etc.
	task.pattern = 'spec_alternate/**/*_spec.rb'
end
```

### Run specs in a browser

`opal-rspec` can use sprockets to build and serve specs over a simple rack
server. Add the following to a `config.ru` file (see config.ru in this GEM):

```ruby
require 'bundler'
Bundler.require
# or use Opal::RSpec::SprocketsEnvironment.new(spec_pattern='spec/opal/**/*_spec.{rb,opal}') to customize the pattern
sprockets_env = Opal::RSpec::SprocketsEnvironment.new
run Opal::Server.new(sprockets: sprockets_env) { |s|
  s.main = 'opal/rspec/sprockets_runner'
  sprockets_env.get_opal_spec_paths.each { |spec_path| s.append_path spec_path }
  s.debug = false
}
```

Then run the rack server `bundle exec rackup` and visit `http://localhost:9292`
in any web browser.

## Async examples

`opal-rspec` adds support for async specs to rspec. These specs can be defined using 2 approaches:

1. Promises returned from subject or the `#it` block (preferred)
1. `#async` instead of `#it` (in use with opal-rspec <= 0.4.3)

### Promise approach

```ruby
describe MyClass do
  # normal example
  it 'does something' do
    expect(:foo).to eq(:foo)
  end

  # async example
  it 'does something else, too' do
    promise = Promise.new
    delay 1 do
      expect(:foo).to eq(:foo)
      promise.resolve
    end
    promise
  end

  it 'does another thing' do
    # Argument is number of seconds, delay_with_promise is a convenience method that will
    # call setTimeout with the block and return a promise
    delay_with_promise 0 do
      expect(:foo).to eq(:foo)
    end
  end
end

describe MyClass2 do
  # will wait for the before promise to complete before proceeding
  before do
    delay_with_promise 0 do
      puts 'async before 'action
    end
  end

  # async subject works too
  subject do
    delay_with_promise 0 do
      42
    end
  end

  it { is_expected.to eq 42 }

  # If you use an around block and have async specs, you must use this approach
  around do |example|
    puts 'do stuff before'
    example.run.then do
      puts 'do stuff after example'
    end
  end
end
```

Advantages:
* Assuming your subject under test (or matchers) return/use promises, the syntax is the same for sync or async specs

Limitations:
* Right now, async `before(:context)` and `after(:context)` hooks cannot be async
* `let` dependencies cannot be async, only subject
* Opal-rspec will not timeout while waiting for your async code to finish

### Async/it approach

This is the approach that was supported in opal-rspec <= 0.4.3 and it still works.

```ruby
describe MyClass2 do
	async 'HTTP requests should work' do
	  HTTP.get('/users/1.json') do |res|
	    async {
	      expect(res).to be_ok
	    }
	  end
	end
end
```

The block passed to the second `async` call informs the runner that this spec is finished
so it can move on. Any failures/expectations run inside this block will be run
in the context of the example.

Advantages:
* Hides promises from the specs

Disadvantages:
* Requires different syntax for async specs vs. sync specs

## Contributing

Install required gems at required versions:

    $ bundle install

opal-rspec uses a prebuilt version of rspec to fix the areas where
opal cannot handle certain features of rspec. To build that file,
which is needed to run specs, use:

    $ bundle exec rake build

This should build `opal/opal/rspec/rspec.js` ready to use.

### Run on command line

A simple rake task should run the example specs in `spec/`:

    $ bundle exec rake

### Run in the browser

Run attached rack app to handle building:

    $ bundle exec rackup

Visit the page in any browser and view the console:

    $ open http://localhost:9292

## Things to fix

`opal/opal-rspec/fixes.rb` contains a few bug fixes that need to be merged upstream
to opal itself. `app/rspec-builder.rb` is used to precompile rspec ready to be used
in `opal-rspec`. All requires from `core.rb` have been inlined as opal cannot require
dynamically at runtime.
